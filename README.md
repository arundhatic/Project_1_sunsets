## The setting sun glare vs. traffic accident rates
### Team Members:
* Grant Thompson
* Arundhati Chakraborty
* Shalin Shekhar

###### Description

We want to explore whether or not there is a greater prevalence of traffic accidents when the sun is setting directly in the view of drivers.  We will startby picking a specific stretch of westbound highway (I-10 or I-8) and pull traffic accident data to find out the average rate of traffic accidents.  We will cross reference that with the times of year that the sun is setting directly over that specific road.

* How do the following variables impact the traffic accident rate
  * Weather Factors (rain, snow, etc)
  * Sunset Glare
  * Traffic
  * Time of the day(rush hour)
  * Day of the week(weekend vs week days)
  
* Breakdown of Tasks:
  * Arun: entire parsing, analysis of accidents contributing to sunset glare close to sunset time
  * Grant: traffic accident data
  * Shalin: data cleanup, verification
