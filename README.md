# Project_1_sunsets

UCSD Project #1The setting sun vs. traffic accident ratesTeam Members:Grant ThompsonArun ChakrabortyShalin ShekharWe want to explore whether or not there is a greater prevalence of traffic accidents when the sun is setting directly in the view of drivers.  We will startby picking a specific stretch of westbound highway (I-10 or I-8) and pull traffic accident data to find out the average rate of traffic accidents.  We will cross reference that with the times of year that the sun is setting directly over that specific road.  How do the following variables impact the traffic accident rate:Weather factors (rain, snow, ice)Sunset glare (directly in your field of view)TrafficTime of day (rush hour) Day of week (weekend vs week)Rough breakdown of tasks:Arun – looking at weather and sun angle datasetsGrant – traffic accident dataDatasets:https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/endpointshttps://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidentsdevelopers.google.com/maps
